### Little, immediate next steps
- The region2vec model needs better integration into the general system for ease-of-use
and currently lacks a snakemake rule.
- The usage guide should provide an easier way to acquire well-suited data. There
should be a script to do a full system demo with minimal setup.
- It may be reasonable to completely automate legacy giggle installation and usage
using conda and snakemake.
- Requiring users to independently install snakemake may be avoidable.
- Statistical test are missing unit tests. And, snakemake workflows.
